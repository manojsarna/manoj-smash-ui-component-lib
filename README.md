## Quick Start

To start using the components in your project, you can refer the following code in your  `<link>` tags or directly use in your css files. Dark Theme has been enabled in Component Library, do check it!!

```html
     <link 
        rel="stylesheet" 
        href="https://smashui.netlify.app/lib/components/smashui.css"
    /> 
```
```css
    @import url("https://smashui.netlify.app/lib/components/smashui.css");
```

Most of Smash UI like Alerts, Ratings, Modal, Toast etc, require the use of JavaScript to function. For using that add the reference of the js files in `<script>` near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. For example :-

```html
     <script 
        src="https://smashui.netlify.app/lib/Components/Rating/rating.js">
    </script>
```
